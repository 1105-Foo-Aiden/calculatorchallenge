**Discription**: Yeah, uh, none of it works, none of the math populates, there's no responsiveness and there's really nothing I can do to help it with the time I have left. 
There are variables that don't link up correctly and the buttons do nothing except for the 15% which changes to an active state, but reverts as soon as you click on something else.

**Comments**: I wish I could write a better review, but I can't right now. The site is not functional at this time. I would suggest looking at other peoples code that got it to work and see if you can get yours up and running. You can do it Aiden, I have faith in you.
